## Automated Threat Intelligence for Illegal Data Leakage with AI
The project focuses on developing an AI-driven threat-intelligence system that detects, analyzes, and prevents illegal data leakage by combining behavioral analytics, semantic content analysis, and external threat monitoring
## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Automated Threat Intelligence for Illegal Data Leakage with AI is designed to address the limitations of traditional Data Loss Prevention (DLP) systems, which rely on static rules and signature-based detection. In modern enterprise environments, sensitive data is exposed to risks such as insider threats, credential misuse, encrypted exfiltration, and covert data transfers that often bypass conventional security controls.

This project leverages artificial intelligence techniques to monitor user behavior, file access patterns, and network activity in real time. Machine learning models establish normal behavior baselines and identify anomalies that may indicate potential data leakage. In addition, semantic content fingerprinting is used to detect sensitive information even when it is modified or obfuscated. The system also integrates external threat-intelligence sources, such as dark-web forums and breach repositories, to validate leakage events. Overall, the project aims to provide an adaptive, scalable, and automated solution for proactive data protection
